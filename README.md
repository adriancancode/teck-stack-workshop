 =============================
 HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON (Mac)
=============================
1. Open the Terminal (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight).
2. Install Homebrew if you donâ€™t already have it:
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
3. Install Python:
   brew install python
4. Verify installation:
   python3 --version


=============================
 HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON (Windows)
=============================
1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
2. Download the latest Python installer (e.g., "Python 3.x.x").
3. Run the installer and:
   - Check the box: "Add Python to PATH"
   - Click "Install Now"
4. Verify installation:
   Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type:
   python --version


=============================
 CHECK IF PYTHON IS INSTALLED
=============================
On Mac (Terminal):
   python3 --version

On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
   python --version

If you see something like "Python 3.x.x", Python is installed correctly.
If you get an error, you may need to reinstall or fix your PATH.

### 3. Start up Development server
Run `python3 app.py` and travel to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
### 3. Have some fun testing out usernames and passwords
